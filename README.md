# STEMREM_205_Final_Project

This repositary cotains the code used to generate the figures and analysis for the paper entitled "Anayzing Differences Between Focal Cortical Dysplasia Subtypes at the Transcriptional Level using snRNAseq" for Stanford STEMREM 205 class. 

The files contained in this repositary and function are below:

1. General_Script.ipynb - used to open the snRNAseq matrix files and initial preprocessing
2. Integration_Final.ipynb - used intergrate all the annData objects for the different samples
3. PAGA_Analysis.ipynb - performs PAGA analysis for samples
4. Reference_Based_Annotation.ipynb - uses annotated dataset to label samples
5. Stem_Marker_Analysis.ipynb - contains code for stem cell analysis
6. DEG_analysis.Rmd - used to perform DEG for the data

The data used for this analysis is available at the following google drive:
